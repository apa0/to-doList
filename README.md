# to-doList
Contains personal to-do list project

Objective: To-Do List application that allows users to add, delete, and modify tasks under different user-input categories

Currently: Will use command line interface; user enters commands from given menu to manage the application (will use input-validation)

Future: 
File I/O to store To-Do list data once user exits program, program will ask user if they want to load in previous to-do lists, user can start off where they left or delete previous data
Want to integrate this into a cleaner visualization, via website eventually? (TBD)
