// To-Do List Project: User.h
//Class that contains a list/vector of Category class objects (which will contain tasks)

//Still not sure if I want to make this a public thing, but I want this class to have user information so I can save it and reopen later on  
//Feel like this class might be simple enough to declare inclass instead of seperate file but not sure
